            <p>
                The importance of an equal treatment of individuals by AI models drastically grows due to the demands of
                modern society. The potential discrimination or favoritism of specific groups of individuals is one of
                the common perspectives for the evaluation of model behavior. However, most of the available fairness
                tools require human intervention in the selection of subgroups of interest and therefore expert
                knowledge. In this paper we propose a new tool, the ASDF-Dashboard, which automates the process of
                subgroup fairness assessment. It automates the subgroup detection by applying a method based on
                unsupervised clustering algorithms and pattern extraction to ease the usage also for non-expert
                users.<br/>

                The ASDF-Dashboard is available open-source at
                <a href="https://github.com/jeschaef/ASDF-Dashboard">GitHub</a>. You can also install and deploy
                the application on your own machine as a self-hosted instance following the instructions given in the
                repository. For example, if you want to keep sensitive data on your machine or network or want to share
                the application to your team, a self-hosted instance would do the job. This way you can restrict access
                to the web service and, e.g., configure a different/unlimited disk quota.
