    st.markdown('The motivation for this master thesis is to explore the potential of predictive data analytics in the field of medicine. '
                'Recent advancements in computer science, such as electronic health record systems, have facilitated the development of '

                'The possible boundaries of this field remain largely undefined, which presents a promising and compelling field for research. '
                'The MIMIC III dataset offers a sufficiently extensive foundation for the construction of prediction models, such as Random Forest, '
                'XGBOOST and deep learning networks. These models shall be evaluated based on their effectiveness, as well as their fairness. '
